#summary This page provides instructions on setting up the FEZ Panda development environment

The FEZ Panda is a micro-controller that is Arduino  pin-output compatible.  The Panda has a 72Mhz 32-bit ARM processor and runs Microsoft .NET Micro Framework.  Writing code for this device is easy using the C# programming language with the free Microsoft Visual C# express IDE.  

More information about the FEZ Panda can be found at  [http://http://www.tinyclr.com tinyclr.com].

This page will provide the necessary software/drivers needed to begin development on Panda platform. 


== Setup ==
To begin developing on the Panda, you will need 4 items:  C# express (IDE), MicroFrameWorkSDK, GHI NETMF SDK, and GHI NETMF USB Drivers.
